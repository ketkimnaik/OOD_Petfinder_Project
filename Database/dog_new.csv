Hi my name is Cleo.  I'm about 3 years old and 7 pounds.  I was abandoned in a home with 6 other dogs living in deplorable conditions.  As you can see my fur is quite a mess, because I was so infested with fleas.  I lost most my fur and had nicks all over my body from scratching and biting to get them off of me.  I am feeling so much better now that I no longer have them on me but my skin does need to heal.  I am on the shy side and would like a quieter home.  I am good with other dogs but lets face it no huge ones for me, I'm too petite.  I'm really sweet once you let me know I can trust you, and will snuggle in your arms.  I will be arriving from KY on Sat. 9/21/19 and plan on being at the adoption event on Sunday 9/22.

Hi my name is Lyra.  I'm about 4 years old and under 15 pounds.  I was abandoned in what I called home with 6 other dogs when our owner moved out and left us to be found by the landlord.  No one is sure how long we were abandoned but it was at least a week but likely more.  I'm in better physical shape then some of the others.  It amazes everyone how sweet and friendly I am considering the deplorable conditions I was found living in.  I will be arriving from KY on Sat. 9/21/19 and plan on being at our adoption event on Sunday 9/22.

Let me introduce myself, I am Rocket, a 5-month-old male Chihuahua/MinPin mix who is 8 pounds of total cuteness!  I am a little fellow won't take up much room except in your heart.

For a pup of my young age, I am very well behaved.  I am not one to chew on hands and even sleep in my kennel crate overnight with no accidents.  I have lots of energy and love to run and play. Rope toys and stuffed animals are my favorites. I do pretty well on a leash but I am fast and will try to pull you along sometimes. After all, I have to live up to my name.

My family moved away and left me behind to fend for myself. A kind neighbor brought me to the safety of the shelter.  My Southern foster parents have enjoyed caring for me and they have faith that I will find a family who will love me and always be there for me because I am  nothing short of precious!

Hey - I'm Zoomer and I am a gosh darn good looking boy! I'm just over a year old and I am a German Shepherd. Some nice people found my brother and I just cruising on down the road and they picked us up and never did find anyone looking for me. I am crate trained and good in the house and do watch that kitty pretty closely but don't seem intent on chasing him. I am very, very active and I do still pull on my leash when I first go on my morning walk but I am way better than I was when I got here. Foster mom says I'm not very smart but I am eager to please and do pay attention most of the time. I love other dogs and am pretty submissive with them. One of my foster sisters is pretty bossy and I just do what she tells me to do and I go with the flow. Foster mom also says you have to let me keep in touch with her because she is going to miss me.

Hi there, my name is Izzy and I am a 2.5-year-old female Parson Russell Terrier/Chihuahua mix.  I am a cuddler and quite a lovebug! At 17 pounds, I am the perfect size for a lap. My foster dad rocks me sometimes and even gives me massages.  I totally adore the attention.

I got into a scuffle with a dog at my previous home, which had multiple dogs.  My impatient owner surrendered me to the shelter rather than trying to correct this one time occurrence.  My foster parents have observed that when I am getting direct attention from her person, I do want full attention.  I will warn another dog not to interrupt or to impinge upon my space.  

I do well on a leash and love walks.  I also have an under bite which only lends to my cuteness. If you are looking for a dog who will be totally devoted to you, please consider me.  I am an all around good girl.

Hi!  I'm Trooper!  I'm a male 2-year-old Chihuahua mix and yes, my face always looks this way!  No,  I'm not drunk. My foster mom says that I should be named Otis (Mayberry's Town Drunk). You see... I did not have a good life before Homeward Bound saved me.  The vet told my foster mom that the reason why my tongue hangs out is because I do not have any teeth on that side of my mouth because sometime during my life someone hit me so hard that they broke my jaw and bashed out my teeth on that side.  There is nothing the nice vet could do for this since it has since healed in place.  My foster mom's nephew watched me get dumped in a subdivision parking area by my 'Real Parents' in the rural area that I was dumped, 
 
I am very good in my crate at night, I do not chew or jump.  My tail is always wagging.  I get along with dogs and cats...but I am slower to get along with small boy dogs.  I am low key and enjoy just hanging around my people.  I am potty trained to a doggie door.  I do need soft food because of my jaw injury and lack of teeth.

Zelda loves to go on walks and sniff after squirrels.  She can be nervous meeting new people though, and takes some time before she is ready to snuggle.
Once you make it on her VIP list she is the best snuggler (with the softest fur), and will cover you with kisses..  She is house trained, and good in a crate (but you may need a piece of cheese to get her in).  She is young so she likes to chew, and is learning that bully sticks and pigs ears are preferable to slippers.  While she does well with respectful kids, an adult home is likely best as there is less coming and going for a cautious dog like Zelda, who is not always a social butterfly.

Hi there, my name is Red (was Nate). I am a 3-year-old male Treeing Walker Coonhound/Redbone Coonhound mix. I am a nice guy who loves his human companions. I even greet some of my most favoritest humans with a classic hound bay! I thrive on routine (walk, poop, eat), enjoy my food and do well training with treats. I love doing zoomies in the backyard, sunbathing, playing fetch with tennis balls and would never turn down a good belly rub. I would make a great running, walking or hiking buddy. I think a home on a farm somewhere could suit me really well. I need to be an only dog though. I have some resource guarding issues so no other animals and no young children for me. I know how to sit, stay, come, down, give paw and leave it. Wait until you see my happy dog smile! So what do you say? Give a great guy a chance?

Hi my name is Stanley.  I'm about 1 year old and 35 skinny pounds.  I was found as a stray in Kentucky.  As the usual story goes, no one came to claim me.  I am a sweet and friendly boy.  I love to be around people.  The shelter director in KY just loves me, she says that I talk with a purpose.  I must have been a chatty person in my previous life.  I don't just sit and bark, I am telling you a story or how I'm feeling or what I would like to do.  If you feel your conversations with people are falling on deaf ears you and I might be a great match because I will listen to you if you listen to me.

Hi my name is Charleston but my foster mom usually calls me Charlie.  I'm about 8 years old and 57 pounds.   I lived with my mom since I was a puppy and for some unknown reason to me she just decided to bring me to the shelter and walk away.   I was very confused and sad at the shelter, not knowing what I could have done for her to bring me to the shelter and walk away.   When I arrived here I knew my world was going to be wonderful.  Pictures the shelter sent mom showed me pretty depressed and sad but you can see from the new pictures I'm happy and even smiling.  I'm a very sweet guy who likes to be close to you.   I would make an awesome addition to your family because I have gone through all the puppy antics and present myself as a very distinguished (my name attests to that) gentleman.  My coat is a very tight curl so I will require professional grooming every six (6) weeks or I will be a knotted mess and that hurts my skin.

Hi, I am Jazzy, a Chihuahua mix female, 10 years old and 10 lb.  My owner passed away and I was taken in by a family member. The family member had good intentions but I was neglected for some time and the financial obligation was too much for them to take on and they brought me to the shelter.  Once I got there, I was treated for both a bacterial and fungal skin infection, had a mass removed from my rectum, had a dental cleaning with some extractions (I only have 2 teeth now) and they got me on proper eye meds for my diagnosed dry eyes.  I am very sweet and have a lot of life. I just hated being in my cage at the shelter and really want to be with people. My skin is still healing but now that the rest of me is in better shape, that should continue to improve.  I am ok with other dogs and I love people.  I am potty pad trained.

Ozzie is a sweet older gentleman who is starting a new journey in his life. He loves to be near his person and get pets. He enjoys sharing a snack. Ozzie rides well in the car and walks well on leash. He really just wants to be someoneÌ¢åÛåªs companion. He barks on meeting other dogs but after sniffing them and getting to know them, he settles down. He is kind of a ladies man. Indoor cats are unknown. He doesnÌ¢åÛåªt have much interest in outdoor cats. He is fine with kids but doesnÌ¢åÛåªt like to be hugged and held, so older children would be best. Ozzie is a simple guy that doesnÌ¢åÛåªt ask for much. His ideal retirement home would be with an older person or couple that just wants a furry friend to hang out with.

Meet our super sweet Max! This tiny boy is an overall well balanced and well rounded puppy. 

Max is the kind of puppy that would pass therapy dog training with flying colors! He is social, happy and outgoing. 

Max is in a foster home with dogs of all sizes and gets along with everyone. He is neutered, microchipped, crate trained, housebroken and up to date on all vaccines. 

Max's date of birth is 1.15.19. 

Max is currently about 9 pounds and we do not believe he will get over 12 pounds. Given his small size, we will not place him in a home with young children. 

If you are interested in meeting Max, please complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org. Please note our adoption requirements and feel free to contact us with any questions. 

** PLEASE NOTE: ALL PETS ON OUR PETFINDER SITE ARE AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION. WE UPDATE THIS LIST DAILY** We do not mark a dog as adopted until all steps are completed, including a home visit.

**NOTE: ALL of our dogs are fostered locally a minimum of 2 weeks. Adopting a dog that has been fostered locally is a very important consideration. Animals that are fostered locally in private homes allow the fosters to learn more about the dogs personality and allows for making the best match possible. Also, animals that are transported into our area and placed directly without being fostered locally often carry diseases, including parvo and distemper. Animals can also become ill on transports to the northeast, as they are exposed to other animals in route. If you have any questions regarding these diseases and the risks of not adopting locally, please contact your vet. 

PLEASE consider any group that does not require a home visit. If they are not conducting a home visit consider if they truly care about their dogs. As an organization, we invest a significant amount of time into all of our dogs, including crate training, house breaking, obedience training, and determining each dog's personality to consider making the best match possible.

Meet Diesel!  This handsome boy came to us from a local back yard breeder. Diesel is in a foster home with other dogs and loves everyone.  Diesel has a soft and gentle disposition and as is evident from his pictures, this is a happy boy! 

Diesel is purebred Husky. As such, we would only place him in a home that understands this breed and has experience with them. He will require a minimum of a 5 foot fence due to the propensity of the breed to climb fences and escape. We will not place him in a home with children under the age of 5 as he will be a big boy.

Diesel is crate trained and is working on housebreaking.

Diesel's date of birth is 05.15.19.

If you are interested in meeting Diesel, please complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org. Please note our adoption requirements and feel free to contact us with any questions.

Sunday came to us in early June from Puerto Rico and has been getting used to life stateside. She can be timid when meeting new people, but given time and space she really devotes herself to her person, and becomes a lovebug who enjoys belly rubs. It just takes her a bit of time to show that side of her to new people. She is a bit of an introvert and will even remove herself from the room when people come over, but once they go is right back to claim her spot on the couch. Sunday is kind of like that person who likes to go to their room and read while everyone else is playing charades (we are sure some of you can relate!). Having only had her since June it is hard to know if she is just still adjusting to a new way of life and will grow to appreciate a more social life, or, if she will always be a dog to prefer some solitude. An adopter should be prepared to love her either way, which is easy to do, she is quite lovable. Sunday is crate trained but is also fine loose in the house, and much prefers hanging out on the couch than in her crate (who wouldnÌ¢åÛåªt!). She is house trained as well. Sunday is social with dogs but has yet to really hang out and play, she likes their company but does not make any demands on them, and seems to prefer dogs that do not make too many demands on her. Sunday loves walks but loves following her nose more, so, she is more the type to take a sniff then a jog through a neighborhood, preferably followed by a nap. She is equally content to just enjoy a yard though. We are not sure how she would do with cats, but we do know she likes to chase squirrels, birds and bunnies, so, she may not be the best choice for a feline companion. Sunday is a homebody and gets very nervous on car rides, and in new places, so she does not come to adoption events, but her foster mom loves talking about her and is happy to chat with anyone looking to learn more about this special girl. Her dream home would be a house with easy-going people, easy-going dogs, a fenced yard with squirrels and bunnies to chase, and the occasional Ì¢åÛåÏsniff through the neighborhood. The simple life!

My name is Gigi, I am around 5 months old, 19 pounds Hound/Terrier Mix.  My story is very sad because I was found in the town of Guayama, Puerto Rico, locked with my Mom on a very small space, probably we would have died there with the high temperatures and lack of food and water.  I am a very friendly and playful puppy, I need training because I jump on people,  I have been in a boarding facility since I was rescued where no one had time to train me.  Even when my sad days were left behind still my eyes tell my story.  I am waiting for the blessing of a forever home that I can call my own.  Please come meet me Saturday!

Hey there, I am Tippy, a male Chihuahua mix who is 2 years old and 13 lb.  My new foster Mom wanted to tell you about me.  We did not have a loving relationship when we meet, I just wanted to bite her and for her to get away from me.  It takes me a while to trust people, that is because people have not always been nice to me.  Now I love her and want nothing more than to be close to her and protect her.
The only people I ever really trusted were kids, they never hurt me.  I get so excited when I see them that I just want to kiss them and make them happy.  Foster mom tells me all the time that I am a good boy and I am beautiful, I don't know if I am but as long as she says so it's ok with me.  I am crate trained even though I do not need a crate because I am so well behaved, I am also house broken.   Come meet me at Homeward Bound.

Hello, my name is Porter and I am 5-year-old male Terrier mix, around 30 lb.  I am a happy, energetic guy who loves everyone.  I love to play, play, play.  I had a radius/ulna fracture - no elbow involvement that is an old fracture that is trying to heal in its own wonky way.  I am not in pain and the vets agree that it is better to let it heal than to amputate my leg. I do need rest for the next 2 months for my leg to fully heal and then need to be evaluated again.  I am looking for a forever home who is willing to give me the chance to heal up and be my happy self.

Hi, my name is Milo.  I am a 5-year-old male Poodle mix who weighs in at a whopping 4-5 lb... maybe!!!  I am a very complex little man.  I LOVE running in the yard and I LOVE other dogs.  However, I am a very scared boy who appears to be shy but it is much more than that.  I follow my person everywhere but I don't want to be picked up and cuddled.  I don't bite out of fear, but I am always looking for an escape route, therefore I am a flight risk.  I hate being left alone and I also don't like being crated.  I am going to need a very special person who is patient and willing to put a lot of time into me.  No children please and no elderly people who want a lap dog, that is not me.   My foster momma is trying to expose me to new situations so I can see that life isn't as scary as I think it is.  I need to continue to be socialized at a very slow pace because deep down I do want to trust people, I just don't know how yet.

Shorty is between 10 and 12 years old. He is a gentle,  short to the ground friendly guy! He is a Beagle/Bassett hound Ì¢åÛåÓand some say maybe even a little bit dachshund. He loves other dogs, cats, and especially people! Shorty also likes to be called,  Ì¢åÛåÏManny.Ì¢åÛåù He is never had an accident in the house ever-ever. He will go number one and number two on command. He absolutely adores riding in a car for any provided he has a chance to stretch his legs and have a drink.  He does know how to put power windows down so that is something to keep in mind. If allowed Ì¢åÛåÒ Ì¢åÛåÒ he will sleep on the bed with you the entire night (although his snores might be a little less amusing when he is dreaming). He has been treated for several years for idiopathic allergies. Inexpensive prednisone and Temaril P seem to keep it at bay with small, quarter doses; he can go several weeks without any doses at all. Selsun blue shampoo works wonders for him as well Ì¢åÛåÒ Ì¢åÛåÒ not for dandruff Ì¢åÛåÒ Ì¢åÛåÒ but to keep any yeast at bay. Shorty would need a fenced yard as an absolute prerequisite. He will take off Ì¢åÛåÒ Ì¢åÛåÒ and he does eventually come back Ì¢åÛåÒ Ì¢åÛåÒ but he is very sneaky around open doors and with people coming and going. He is highly food motivated Ì¢åÛåÒ Ì¢åÛåÒ and has been known to get up on a table and help himself to unattended plates. DonÌ¢åÛåªt let his short little legs for you. He can find a gum in a purse or pocket of a coat but has not destroyed material things Ì¢åÛåÓwith the exception of a lunch sack and a backpack zipper. Please consider giving him a loving home where are you promise to hug and kiss him.

Are you looking for a best friend? Someone to follow you around and cuddle with on the couch? Someone to lay in the backseat of your car and go for a drive with? Meet Marnie, an incredibly gentle and sweet dog who loves company and cuddle sessions. She gets along wonderfully with all dogs and people. She doesnÌ¢åÛåªt live with cats but we are fairly certain she would be fine with them. However, loud noises and quick movements will scare her as she is a bit shy, especially at first. Marnie has a kind soul and is such an easy dog to love. She will put a gentle paw on you for attention, she rarely barks and loves nothing more than to sleep on her dog bed or the couch. She has wonderful house manners and is left out to do what she wishes (which is mainly sleep or follow around whoever is in the house). Marnie has some skin problems (alopecia and lot of lumps and bumps) as well as some environmental allergies. The dermatologist is not certain her lost fur will ever grow back, but Marnie doesnÌ¢åÛåªt mind, and she has some awfully cute pajamas to keep her warm in the winter. Marnie also had a series of seizures in April (happened only once) and those are now being controlled with medicine. Her medical issues are easily handled with medication and bi-weekly dog baths. She walks wonderfully on a leash and loves to meet different dogs. Marnie is such an easy dog to love and live with. She is looking for a family of her own, could you be it?

Pirate is in fact back, having let us know that he prefers his canine friends to be the type that ignore him and give him space. Busy or bossy friends stress Pirate out, and stress is not PirateÌ¢åÛåªs friend. What is PirateÌ¢åÛåªs friend is food . . . he really loves food, and sleeping on the couch, and dancing when he is excited to see you (or when he sees his food dish). Pirate also enjoys his time outside, just not outside in the snow please, he is a warm weather dog. Pirate also likes scratches on his head and ear rubs, but only when he wants them, and not when he does not. Pirate likes snuggling, on his terms, he will sometimes lay next to you and rest his head on your leg and you can scratch his soft little head. But when he is done, he is done. Pirate is a one of a kind guy, seriously. Peppertree has been around for 20 years, and we have never met another dog like him, he is cranky and sweet and smart and spazzy but to know him is to love him, and to love him is to accept him as he is . . . and he is a little, well, odd. Undiagnosed high blood pressure left him with some vision issues, and ataxia, which worsen when he is nervous, and can lead to some odd behaviors Ì¢åÛåÒ like walking on his front feet. Pirate does not really do walks, he has limited vision and while he does sometimes enjoy a jaunt into the real world, surprises like another dog quickly approaching, or a bike, can send him into a panic, and when he panics he really panics. So, he requires a fenced yard for the sake of his sanity, and for his house training. Pirate also is very sensitive about handling, so he needs a house without stairs (or that can keep him on one floor) because he does not like to be carried. At all. But Pirate does like to work for food, he will solve puzzles to get treats, he loves his snuffle mat, and while he cannot quite manage to maneuver a Kong, he loves licky mats and other frozen treats. Pirate can live with other dogs and even seems to enjoy their company sometimes, but the other dogs need to really get Pirate, and not be bothered by his theatrics. Cats however are perfectly acceptable. Kids are far too unpredictable for Pirate and he does need an adult only home, although he would happily relax in another room with a treat if children do visit.

Magdalina Conchetta Wrinkles, or Maggie to friends and family, packs a lot of personality into her 20 lb frame. She is loving, funny, smart and determined. She also has a lot of opinions, and those opinions must be respected by the other dogs in her life. When a toy is hers, it is hers, when a treat is hers, it is hers, when a lap is hers . . . well, that she will sometimes share because the more body warmth the better. Her foster family firmly blames themselves for her occasional possessiveness, they not only fed her after midnight, they got her wet. Luckily with people she is far more willing to compromise and is generally a very agreeable house guest. Maggie is an expert snuggler, and is excellent at camouflaging in a pile of blankets (you learn to watch where you sit!) Maggie knows how to relax, and takes napping very seriously, as proven by her snoring which can be heard several rooms away. We are not going to lie, she has a list of health issues, dry eye has left her blind in one eye with limited vision in the other, and requires daily drops, she has a fused elbow which gives her an adorable skip to her step, back pain and skin issues Ì¢åÛåÒ but she certainly doesnÌ¢åÛåªt let it get to her and is a wonderful patient. Mags has good house manners, she is not destructive (although she will steal your socks and carry them around) but she is still working on house training. She is not used to holding it, and while she will ask to go out, she has to go out frequently. Mags also knows how to make friends, and while she can get nervous in hew places, she delights in giving kisses and getting back scratches, so a friendly lap goes a long way to making her happy. Because of her vision and orthopedic issues, a house without stairs or an owner who can carry her up and down stairs is required, as is a fenced yard, and she would not do well with young children. She does very well with cats and respectful dogs of all sizes. MagdalinaÌ¢åÛåªs perfect day involves lots of time on the couch, a goat horn or bully stick to chew, lots of treats, and lots of love.

**Hi, Webster here.   If you're interested in meeting me and you already have a dog, contact my foster family as the weekly clinics overwhelm me. I'd love to meet you!**

IÌ¢åÛåªm approximately 2 years old and 47 lbs but my foster mom is constantly concerned IÌ¢åÛåªm losing weight because IÌ¢åÛåªm not food motivated. The moment my doggy foster siblings are done with food, I am too! I would rather play with them than eat, doesnÌ¢åÛåªt every dog? If my siblings are too tired to play, then the next acceptable solution is cuddling with humans. I love to lay right on them, especially if I can flop first but if another dog must lay closer to humans, IÌ¢åÛåªm fine cuddling up to the dog instead. I donÌ¢åÛåªt like crates, but thatÌ¢åÛåªs ok. As long as you leave me with another dog (or 2 or 3, IÌ¢åÛåªm not picky) IÌ¢åÛåªm non-destructive. See how reasonable I am? IÌ¢åÛåªm completely potty-trained, know basic commands, and have lived with kids before. I do need a proper introduction to other dogs but once IÌ¢åÛåªm introduced, IÌ¢åÛåªll act as if IÌ¢åÛåªve known them all my life! My foster mom said I have to tell you that IÌ¢åÛåªm a champion counter surfer. I think this is an attractive trait because regardless of whether you leave food on the counters or not, they will be clean by the time you get home.

Liesel is a country girl at heart, who dreams of long walks in the woods and a big yard to play in with her canine siblings. She loves to play fetch, especially in water, and looks forward to her walks every day. After a nice long walk or play session, Liesel can be found cuddling on the couch or a comfy bed with her foster siblings.She takes some time to warm up to humans, but she is very devoted and snuggly once she does.

Liesel is an introvert and while she is okay with visitors, she will not engage with them and prefers to hide on the couch under a blanket. She will need a quiet home with limited comings and goings. LieselÌ¢åÛåªs foster family reports that she is extremely well-behaved Ì¢åÛåÓ crate-trained, housebroken, rides nicely in the car, walks well on leash, and never jumps, counter surfs, or barks in the house. She has not been tested with cats, but she does have high prey drive and we suspect she would try to play with them at the very least, so would not place her with a kitten or a timid cat. She does have a few fears (children, moving cars, loud noises), but these are manageable in a suburban or country setting. Due to her shyness, Liesel requires a forever home with a secure physical fence and another dog to reassure her.

Hi my name is Duke.  I'm about 2 years old and under 15 pounds.  I'm originally from Kentucky where I lived with two other dogs until our owner couldn't afford to care for us any more.  I've been in my foster home since Jan. 2019.   As you can see from my pictures, I love to be on a lap, it  doesn't matter whose, as long as I can be close to someone.  I am really a people dog.   I have quite the personality.  I'm a lover, a snuggler, a kisser, a hoarder of toys/bones, a thief of toys/bones from the other dogs and a bit of a napoleon.  I'm not a fan of big dogs....there's that napoleon complex, or submissive dogs because I like to be the big cheese.  If another dog puts me in my place when I try to be bossy, I will typically be their friend unless toys are involved and then I'm going to steal them.  My foster mom noticed my back legs would sometimes kick out, like they slipped out of the socket.  The doctor examined me and noticed I didn't have knee sockets in my back legs.  I had a successful surgery.  I hated being confined and not being able to run and play with my foster friends, but I survived the healing period and have been released by the doctor.  Since I never had the stability in my legs I was not able to jump.  Now that my legs are fixed, I can jump, but my brain doesn't know that.  If you have a cat, it must like to play and be chased.  I know there is someone out there looking for a little lovable goofball like me...I just wish they would hurry up and meet me on Sunday from 11:00 - 1:45 pm at PetsMart.

Although they say IÌ¢åÛåªm Luna 2, my foster mom calls me Idgie, because I have way too much personality to be considered #2 at anything! I am approximately 8 months old, and based on the speculation of my foster mom and two vets, probably a mix of Pointer and a Bully breed, plus some other unknown breeds as well. I get along well with dogs that are tolerant of my energetic, playful demeanor, and need my future humans to have lots of stamina as well! I would be the perfect companion for hikes, runs or romping around in the back yard regularly...but foster mom says the backyard has to have a fence for me. She also has told me that IÌ¢åÛåªm a pretty smart, confident pup, so IÌ¢åÛåªd do best with humans that are experienced dog owners. IÌ¢åÛåªm about 40 lbs, potty trained, and I already know how to sit, lie down, give my paw...and PS I love treats!

We arenÌ¢åÛåªt sure of GrantÌ¢åÛåªs breed. Maybe hound mix? Grant is a handsome southern boy who is young, active, and smart. He is food motivated and loves to learn for treats. Grant recently completed a Canine Good Citizen class and now has his CGC certificate! And his trainer loves this happy and motivated boy.

Grant is at his best when he has a job and plenty of exercise. He loves to chase a ball and play tug. Grant could excel at agility, AKC, rally or nose work. For someone who wanted to get into dog sport, he would be an excellent candidate. Grant obviously has hunt breeding in his genes. A fenced in yard would work well for him, since he likes to chase deer and squirrels (and probably cats!) He has gained more confidence and has become more social, now seeing everyone as the giver of treats! Grant is house trained and crate trained. HeÌ¢åÛåªs not really much of a couch potato, but can settle in the house pretty easily. He bonds with his people, enjoys their attention and looks for their approval. He loves to go running and for hikes. Grant would rather not share his person with another dog. He enjoys older kids. Grant likes to meet people on his terms and get to know them more slowly. He knows his special person is out there, he just needs to get them to notice him. He is so deserving. The trainers where he is currently being boarded are offering a private training package for the adopter if interested. Prospective adopters who would like to meet Grant should fill out an adoption application and email rescue@peppertree.org so we can set up a meeting.

I am on medications that I will likely need to stay on all of my life and I should not go to a home with children.

Well hello there, my name is Biker and I am a male Rat Terrier mix, 4 years old and 12 lb. Now that I have been in my foster home for a while my Mom wants you to know more about me.   I am a very loving guy but it does take a little while for me to get comfortable with you.  I will bark at you if you do not pay attention to me.  I have not had the easier life, my foster Mom took me to the vet because sometimes I hold my back leg up.  The vet told her it was some an old injury, if I could have talked I could have told her that and would not have had an x-ray.  The vet confirmed it was from an old injury and that I am not in any pain and because I do use the leg a lot he suggested leaving it on.  Came meet me on Sat.  Even though I am 4 I have a lot of love and life in me.

Bear was emaciated and the shelter vet believed that he was gravely ill. Bear went to our vet immediately and was diagnosed with Lyme disease and hook worms, for which he was treated. He weighed 133lbs at that time and he currently up to 165lbs. A blood panel was conducted and everything came back normal. 
Bear is in foster care with large and small dogs and he gets along with everyone. He is house trained and does well off leash in the yard once bonded with you. 
Bear is a bit of a high maintance boy; He cannot walk on hardwood floors and stairs are difficult for him to navigate because of the arthritis in his backend. He needs his ears cleaned on a regular basis and he tends to need him bum wiped too. We've been giving him weekly medicated baths because he has oily skin. Oh and he is a huge drooler! 
Despite all of his needs, Bear is a very affectionate and gentle giant. He is very well behaved and we would love to find him the perfect home. 
We have not tested Bear with cats and we will not place him in a home with young children.

While her looks suggest she might be a chocolate lab mix, her personality is more like a regal old soul, she just doesnÌ¢åÛåªt quite fit the goofiness associated with that breed, and we debate her heritage regularly. Is she a Chesapeake Bay retriever mix?  A terrier mix?

Is she a cat trapped in a dogÌ¢åÛåªs body? We only know Nika is a beautiful, independent girl who takes her time to get to know new people, but once you are in her circle you can see how special she is.

Nika has been with us for a while because she is a true unique spirit, and we know she is just waiting for that perfect home and that we just have to be a bit more proactive in finding it. She is smart and cautious, although roast beef goes a long way in helping her make new friends. Nika can be nervous meeting new people, which has made it a challenge to find her a home, as she does not connect with people until she trusts them, so she needs someone who will take that time and appreciate that her affection is not easily won. Nika likes to do her own thing, sniff the yard, play with a toy, but when she is in the mood she loves a good ear scratch or butt scratch.



If Nika could pick her perfect home we suspect she would pick a quiet one, one set far back from the hustle and the bustle, near woods for quiet walks, and maybe with a pond so she can swim (she loves to swim). An adult or two to love her, and take her for walks, and with a nice yard for her to explore and sniff and enjoy. Nika was returned to us because the children in the home brought energy and activity that made her nervous, so we would like to see her in an adult only home. She can also get overwhelmed with a lot of activity outside the home so a busy neighborhood with lots of kids and dogs around can be too much for her; she thrives in a rural setting.

Nika does fine being crated for a work day and seems to enjoy the time to nap, chew her chews, and reflect on life.  She is also house trained, and has good house manners. Once she is used to her person, she comes when called off-leash. In the past Nika has lived with a male dog, and cats, but we are not sure if she wants to continue sharing her home. As she has matured she may prefer to be the queen of all she surveys, but she may do well with the right dog. We are not sure. We are sure, though, that with love and consistency, Nika is able to relax and be such a wonderful dog, who will make someone very, very happy.** If you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete an adoption application at http://peppertree.org/adoptapp.php. Or visit our site (http://peppertree.org/adoptlist.php) and learn about other Peppertree dogs. *Note: visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

Hi I'm Gordy a 3 year old, 43 lb, Feist/Terrier mix. I am an active dog that LOVES to be with my people. I am very loyal and very affectionate and will follow you around all day. I love to run and exercise. I would make a great companion for a jogger or a biker. I run alongside my foster Dad's bike almost every day. If you're not a jogger I love to go on walks and hikes. I'm good in the house and in the car and with kids.My foster Mom calls me her \""Velcro dog\"" because I always want to sit on her lap. My foster parents have taken me many places and I have been great wherever we go. I love boats and swimming at the lake too.

I like to be the alpha dog so I shouldn't live with another male dog. I don't like dogs that are bigger than me but I would probably be ok with a smaller female dog. I have a very strong prey drive so no cats or small animals for me. I would need a fenced in yard to get out some of my energy. I am very smart and easy to train and I love my treats. If you're looking for an exercise buddy and someone to snuggle with while you watch TV then come see me at Homeward Bound.

We cannot say enough about this wonderful girl! Found in a ravine with her 6 babies, she was smart enough to alert a human that she needed help! 

Abby plays like a puppy and we think she is almost a baby herself - probably just a year old.  Abby was a wonderful mom to her babies and now deserves a home of her own. Abby gets along with other well behaved dogs with proper introductions. 

Abby is 41 pounds, spayed and housebroken. 

Abby clearly did not have the best start with humans but boy has that all changed! After just a couple of days, she now likes to throw herself against her human for cuddling and rubs. She allows all handling, even when the vet came for an exam, shots and a microchip! The only time we still see signs of \""scared Abby\"" is if you are carrying something in your hands but her foster mom is working on that. 

We are looking for a special home for Abby, one that will have the time and patience to continue with her training and socializing. We would only place Abby in a home with older children as she is fearful of new people at first. 

If you are interested in meeting Abby, please complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org. Please note our adoption requirements and feel free to contact us with any questions. Thank you.

Please note: All of our dogs are fostered locally a minimum of 2 weeks. Adopting a dog that has been fostered locally is a very important consideration. Animals that are fostered locally in private homes allow the fosters to learn more about the dogs personality and allows for making the best match possible. Also, animals that are transported into our area and placed directly often carry diseases, including parvo and distemper. Animals can also become ill on transports to the northeast, as they are exposed to other animals in route. If you have any questions regarding these diseases and the risks of not adopting locally, please contact your vet. 

Also consider any group that does not require a home visit. If they are not conducting a home visit consider if they are vested in where their animals go. As an organization, we invest a significant amount of time into all of our dogs, including crate training, house breaking, obedience training, and determining each dog's personality to consider making the best match possible.

Help Orphan Puppies is registered with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Our Rescue Registration Number is RR047.

Please note that Petfinder requires us to identify a breed/breeds. We do our best to determine a puppy's breed but without both parents present, we are unable to guarantee a puppy's breed."39409275,TX1226,https://dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net/photos/pets/39409275/1/?bust=1505704476&width=300,Dog,Labrador Retriever,Shar-Pei,TRUE,FALSE,White / Cream,Adult,Male,Medium,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,TRUE,FALSE,Barnie - N,,adoptable,2017-09-18T03:12:57+0000,Albany,NY,12203,US,CT,43728,Dog,"Barnie is a sweet, handsome boy.

Hello there, my name is Maggie and I'm an 9-year-old Miniature Schnauzer. My \""throwing arm\"" has some problems we can't fix. I'm quite good at getting around on 3 legs and when I'm feeling energetic, I even run!
I have something called Cushings Disease, which was untreated for a long time, so it took some time to get me healthy again. I'll be on meds for life along with getting regular blood tests done, and I must say I feel great now! My new owner will need to be informed on the complexities so they know how to take good care of me.

I enjoy lounging with the family at night--especially when I get picked up to lay on the couch. During the day I like to stay busy outside and really prefer the outdoors no matter what the weather is like, so my new home should have a nice fenced yard for me to explore at my own pace. I will need to keep up on my exercise and still have a few extra pounds to work off. Did I tell you how much I love toys?? The soft stuffed ones are my favorite and I take very good care of them. I greet people at the door wagging my little nub tail and protect my house from strangers. I get along with other dogs (actually, I love them), cats, and older children. 

I'm such an easygoing laid back gal and I know my perfect people will come along soon!

This sweet girl was rescued locally.  Dani is an abuse case and has several injuries, including multiple upper and lower jaw fractures as well as a fracture to one of the bones in her left ear that assists with hearing.  Dani underwent weekly procedures for about 6 months and several surgeries and is now healed.  Unfortunately given the severity of the abuse, Dani will never appear normal but don't tell her that!  

Due to the abuse, Dani suffers from Microcephaly.  Dani also has severe separation anxiety.  We have seen numerous specialists for this and Dani is now on prescription medication but it has not completely resolved the issue. 

Despite all that she has been through, Dani is simply the happiest dog!  She does not know a stranger, 2 legged or 4 legged!  In typical lab fashion, she is an active girl but not overly active!   

Dani has earned her CGC, TDI, and CGCA titles.  

Dani cannot be crated.  She is about 90% housebroken but will have accidents once she begins spinning if left alone. 

If you are interested in meeting Dani, please complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org.  Please note our adoption requirements and feel free to contact us with any questions.  Thank you.

Please note:  All of our dogs are fostered locally a minimum of 2 weeks.  Adopting a dog that has been fostered locally is a very important consideration. Animals that are fostered locally in private homes allow the fosters to learn more about the dogs personality and allows for making the best match possible.  Also, animals that are transported into our area and placed directly often carry diseases, including parvo and distemper.  Animals can also become ill on transports to the northeast, as they are exposed to other animals in route.  If you have any questions regarding these diseases and the risks of not adopting locally, please contact your vet.  

Also consider any group that does not require a home visit.  If they are not conducting a home visit consider if they are vested in where their animals go.  As an organization, we invest a significant amount of time into all of our dogs, including crate training, house breaking, obedience training, and determining each dog's personality to consider making the best match possible.

Help Orphan Puppies is registered with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Our Rescue Registration Number is RR047.

Please note that Petfinder requires us to identify a breed/breeds.  We do our best to determine a puppy's breed but without both parents present, we are unable to guarantee a puppy's breed."36672208,TX1226,https://dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net/photos/pets/36672208/1/?bust=1582916844&width=300,Dog,Boerboel,,TRUE,FALSE,Red / Chestnut / Orange,Adult,Male,Medium,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,FALSE,Nero - N,,adoptable,2016-11-06T22:31:13+0000,Albany,NY,12203,US,CT,43728,Dog,"Introducing Nero.

Wilmington is the black and white one;  Larson is the fawn and white one.   This pair is very attached to one another so we are looking for a forever home that can take them both.  A little history:  they were rescued from a high kill shelter in which the shelter planned on putting Mama (Wilmington) to sleep while placing her baby (Larson) up for adoption.  We couldnÌ¢åÛåªt let that happen.  We took them in and have been so touched by the bond they share. Their breed is hard to pinpoint Ì¢åÛåÒ clearly they are mixes - we see some lab but not sure what else.  Mama Wilmington is a caring and gentle soul, sometimes mildly shy at first, but is well mannered and likes to please.  She politely waits for direction and guidance from her human then tries her best to please.  She is very good with other dogs as well as humans as is Larson but please no cats as they don't seem to like them.  She continues to dote on her boy Larson and if Larson is with you, you can count on Mama to be close by.  She is content to quietly lay in the sun and watch Larson play - she is not as interested in the rough and tumble as he is, but she always keeps a watchful eye on him.  Larson will amuse you with his clown-like antics while he runs about and plays.  We approximate Wilmington to have been born around 2010 and Larson 2014. Both are around 45 lbs.

Approximate age       7 years 1 month 

Approximate weight      88

Breed (s)  lab mix        

Spayed or neutered? Yes

 
Good with:      

kids?      N/A- came from a home with an infant. 

strangers?   Yes. Is quick to accepting people, especially women. She does not act bad towards men she would just approach a female before a male while in the same room.

other dogs?  She was good in the home with my 2 labs. Was OK in same area as female dog, however possessive of her property when approached by hyper female dog, low aggression as a warning, no bites/fights. Can be worked on. Recommend slow introductions. 

cats?        N/A - has not been around one

On-leash? Bailey is very good in a leash. She listens to direction very well and distractions do not phase her. Good at ignoring strangers walking or kids riding bikes and runners.

Housetrained - Yes. Does very good on her own. No accidents, no chewing. Does not appear to have separation anxiety which is a plus.

Crate trained - N/A. She seemed hesitant to enter the crate we had for her, let her work around it on her own terms. Maybe due to bad experience being in the shelter.

Paper trained - No, does not need.

Preferred forever home for your foster:

She is very good at adapting to her surroundings. She will most likely THRIVE in a home without young children or other dogs. She IS good with dogs but she is possessive of her toys. She did well with my Under 2-year-old labs. Both male. We did meet a female who she was protective of her toys, moderate aggression, no biting more of a backoff warning. Her possession issues CAN be trained out of her with someone willing to take the time to work with her. It may just be female dogs she is like this too. She just doesnÌ¢åÛåªt want to lose her toys. 

We say no young children because we donÌ¢åÛåªt know how she could be with fast, sleek movements from a toddler/small child.  Middle school-aged children and older would be sufficient.

She still has the energy she needs to get out so land or fenced in yard would be very beneficial 
 

Interesting quirks/behaviors

       - She doesnÌ¢åÛåªt understand she is not a Ì¢åÛåÏlapÌ¢åÛåù dog. She likes to sit on the couch next to people and twist and turn to almost sitting on your lap

       - Considering that is just turned 7, she has a good activity level. She still gets the zoomies and itÌ¢åÛåªs just so cute. 

        - she loves cuddling, she will lay with you on the couch and wants to sleep at the end of your bed or next to you. 

        - Bailey knows basic obedience commands and listens very well.

        - she loves fetch and frisbee
 

Issues 

      - Her possession Ì¢åÛåÏaggressionÌ¢åÛåù so they call it. Can be worked on. Little is known but she likes to say MINE when approached by female dogs while playing with her toys(tried taking it) This instance happened with a 3yr old pit (high energy - May be too much for her at first) 

     
Foster Dad has this to say about Bailey:

I have no clue where to begin, so I may just ramble on. Bailey is just so sweet and genuine and trusting. She really adores attention and affection. She seems to trust people which shows us she hasnÌ¢åÛåªt been a victim of abuse. It breaks our heart to think about how she got dumped at a shelter and was set to be euthanized while having this admiration for people. She has done so well and transitioned very quickly into our home directly after coming from the shelter. Honestly, within 24 hours she was acting like she was back home after leaving on a long vacation. She learned where she has to go potty (NO ACCIDENTS!) She will walk to the door when she wants to go out. She adapted to our routine very quickly. She grew fond of our 2 in-home labs, they were hesitant at first but didnÌ¢åÛåªt exchange any emotions toward each other. 

Bailey loves to play with balls and frisbees. Sometimes she will even potty with them in her mouth. She WILL let you know when she wants to play. And when she does her inner puppy comes out and itÌ¢åÛåªs so admiring. She can still run around and play like a pup but at the same time around the home, she is very responsible and well behaved. When she trusts you she will become submissive and let you know itÌ¢åÛåªs time for pets and scratches on her belly. She loves hugs and will even hug back. When she trusts you. 

She lets you know when she wants to be pet. She will sit next to you or around you and put her one paw up and make an up-down motion. Her tail wags vigorously and you can see the happiness in her eyes. 

Bailey is very well behaved when at home alone. She will hang out and just lay wherever you place a dog bed. At our home she likes to spend her time alone in the kitchen. We found she likes to lay between the stove and the sink so we began laying her dog bed there when we leave. We have indoor pet canes to monitor and we found that when we left she would walk to her safe spot, lay down and remain there until we returned, even on longer instances 4-5 hours or so she didnÌ¢åÛåªt care to roam. 

Bailey LOVES to sunbathe. She would approach the door and we would go out with her, we were finding she would just go lay sprawled out on the deck and stay there and not want to come inside. She does enjoy having her own time and being independent but wants you within arms reach at the same time. 

I could go on and on about her but I am going to include (below) a few Ì¢åÛåÏtestimonialsÌ¢åÛåù from people who have personally had independent encounters with her:

Ì¢åÛåÏBailey is a very sweet, easy going dog when you meet her . She was comfortable coming up to us. She loved being petted and the more attention you have her the better! she was very trusting, there didnÌ¢åÛåªt seem to be much that would make her uncomfortable . She will make a great pet!Ì¢åÛåù

Ì¢åÛåÏWhen I first briefly met Bailey, I could hear her barking from outside, but once I entered the house, the barking stopped, and she couldnÌ¢åÛåªt stop wagging her stump!  She was as happy as a clam!  She was not suspicious of me what so ever, rather she was excited to meet someone new!  She allowed me to pet her, and was excellent with recall while visiting in the backyard. 

Later in the week, I spent the day visiting.  Bailey showed us she knows basic commands such as Ì¢åÛå÷sitÌ¢åÛåª and Ì¢åÛå÷lay downÌ¢åÛåª.  She did excellent with loose leash walking, and even enjoyed going for a jog.  During our walk/jog, Bailey did not react to other barking dogs or children out playing.  She is very treat motivated, which would make it easier if more advanced training is desired.  

We played some mental stimulation games, and when she didnÌ¢åÛåªt want to play anymore, she carried the game into the living room and hid it under the couch.  We also played catch with a frisbee, in which when she retrieved the frisbee, she gave a soft warning growl when I tried to take it out of her mouth.  She then dropped the frisbee and allowed me to pick it up and throw it again, without any issue or concern.  That soft warning growl tells me that either she has had toys taken from her, right out of her mouth in the past, so sheÌ¢åÛåªs trying to be protective, or that she was having fun and wanted to continue to play.  Based on her continuous repetitive reaction, it appears to me to be a playful growl.   

IÌ¢åÛåªve rescued, as well as fostered many abused, extremely aggressive dogs, and have successfully rehabilitated puppy mill survivors over the last 18 years.  After interacting with Bailey, I still question how and why she was an owner surrendered.  

In my opinion, observation and interactions with Bailey, she wants nothing more than to give and be given attention, affection and love.  

At this time I feel confident that Bailey would find her fur-ever home with adults, families with children that are 12+yo that are able to respect her, or in a 1 person household, where she could be the center of her persons world.Ì¢åÛåù"46034245,TX2340,https://dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net/photos/pets/46034245/1/?bust=1568922003&width=300,Dog,Border Collie,Australian Cattle Dog / Blue Heeler,TRUE,FALSE,"Tricolor (Brown, Black, & White)",Adult,Male,Medium,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,Howie,,adoptable,2019-09-19T19:48:28+0000,Syracuse,NY,13217,US,NY,43728,Dog,"Licorice is a 12 week old, male, Border Collie X Lab mix.

History

IÌ¢åÛåªve lived with my family in Ithaca for about 4 months. Before that, I had spent my whole life in shelters, which was very sad and scary for a tiny puppy! I was born in Alabama, landed in a shelter there, and then was transported at 4 months old to a no-kill shelter in Binghamton, NY.  Whew!  That was lucky!  Then I got adopted by my current family and life started to get much better!

I learned so much in the past 4-5 months!  I got house-broken, learned how to walk on a leash, what kinds of furniture were ok to be on (couches) and what kinds werenÌ¢åÛåªt (tables, haha!), and even how to play with toys (so new!  so fun!)  IÌ¢åÛåªve come a long way since my adoption, if I donÌ¢åÛåªt say so myself!. IÌ¢åÛåªm now great on my leash, IÌ¢åÛåªm totally housebroken, and I prefer chewing on my toys rather than on furniture. My family is really proud of me, they say that since I am so young, still a puppy really, this is incredibly impressive and that I am clearly very very smart!

Personality

Everyone says IÌ¢åÛåªm SUCH A GOOD BOY!!!  Sweet and funny and incredibly good-natured, eager to please, enthusiastic about life, adorable, loving, friendly, and smart!  The trainer that my family hired even once told me she thought IÌ¢åÛåªd make a great therapy dog!  I learn things really fast, and I will do anything for a tasty treat!   The tricks IÌ¢åÛåªm best at are sit, lay down, stay, leave it, take it, come, shake, and high five! IÌ¢åÛåªve also been working on learning to heel, roll over, spin, fetch and sit pretty! 

I love to play!  Especially with my dog friends at the park!  My family takes me to the dog park almost every morning which is so awesome for me. I love to play with all kinds of dogs! When I was really young, I really liked to wrestle and use my mouth to play but now that IÌ¢åÛåªm older, I prefer to run and be chased! I sometimes get a group of my friends together and get them to chase me around the trees and benches while I show off my agility!  Haha, so fun!. Since IÌ¢åÛåªm still a puppy, I still like to wrestle if the other dogs I meet want to, but IÌ¢åÛåªm starting to grow out of this kind of play a bit. 

I also love to snuggle!!!! When my family is home, I just want to rest my head on their laps and curl up for a nap while they read or watch TV. If my family is doing chores around the house, I like to help out, and I stay close by. 


My family really enjoys hiking in the gorges, and IÌ¢åÛåªve found that I really like this too! I love smelling all of the scents left behind by squirrels, chipmunks, deer, and other hikers.   I also recently discovered that I LOVE to swim!  This is definitely the Lab in me, as Beagles often dislike water.  Not me!   I play fetch in the lake!  I lay down in the kiddie pool at the dog park! If thereÌ¢åÛåªs water, I want to be in it!!   When IÌ¢åÛåªm in the water, my family thinks IÌ¢åÛåªm funny because I love to chomp-chomp-chomp the water, rather than drinking it gently. What can I say? I love water!

Cohabitation

I really love love love people, and people love me too!  I donÌ¢åÛåªt currently live with any kids, but I like the ones IÌ¢åÛåªve met. I can get a little confused if young children run or scream (I tend to think they are puppies and so want to interact with them that way), so I would do best in a home with older children who are beyond the running/screaming stage of life. 

I donÌ¢åÛåªt currently live with any dogs, either, but I would absolutely love to share a home with another dog! It would be so cool to have a friend that I could play with at home or in our backyard!  Yes yes yes!  But if I am your only dog, then if you could bring me to the dog park or to friendÌ¢åÛåªs houses to play with their dogs, or to doggy daycareÌ¢åÛå?that would work too!

My family does have two cats that IÌ¢åÛåªve been trying so very hard to get along with. Unfortunately, after a lot of hard work and training, I still donÌ¢åÛåªt understand that cats are part of the family. I really like to chase the cats and bark at them if my parents give them any attention. When the cats are around, no one can relax, so I really canÌ¢åÛåªt live in a home with cats. 

Favorite Activities
Ì¢åÛå¢	Playing at the dog park!
Ì¢åÛå¢	Snuggling with my family!
Ì¢åÛå¢	Going for hikes!
Ì¢åÛå¢	Swimming!
Ì¢åÛå¢	Playing with my toys!
Ì¢åÛå¢	Learning new tricks and practicing the training IÌ¢åÛåªve already learned!
Why I am looking for a new home
IÌ¢åÛåªm looking for a new home because of the cats who have lived with my family longer than I have. I canÌ¢åÛåªt relax when they are around, and my family has to keep a really close eye on me or keep me in my crate when they arenÌ¢åÛåªt around so that I donÌ¢åÛåªt hurt the cats. 

Medical
I donÌ¢åÛåªt have any known medical conditions. IÌ¢åÛåªm a young and healthy pup!

Summary
In my ideal home, IÌ¢åÛåªd have active, happy, fun people who love me and want to spend a lot of time with me! My people would want to take me for long walks, hikes or runs.!I would love to live with someone who could make sure I get to play with a lot of other dogs, as this is really the highlight of every day for me!


I know my family is really sad to see me go. We have all worked really hard together to make living with the cats a possibility, but my instinct to chase is just too strong. 


If you have a home that doesnÌ¢åÛåªt have any cats for me to chase, and if you are looking for a real snuggle buddy, I might be the perfect guy to add to your family!

\""When Rosie arrived at the shelter in January she was sad, confused, terrified and unapproachable. I immediately saw the sweet dog hiding behind those sad terrified eyes and made it my mission to earn her trust.

The first 2 weeks were full of ups and downs. After many lunch breaks by her kennel, bags of treats, mini training sessions and selfies it was time to get her outside! It took 20 minutes to get a loop leash on without startling her too much. She cowered as we made our way to the play yard. Every noise sending her closer to the ground. When we finally made it, I looked into her eyes with nothing but trust and respect. I dropped her leash to let her explore. It took 10 minutes before she would leave my side. Every minute that passed you could see the fun loving happy dog coming out. After she finally got some zooms around the play yard in, she came over to me soliciting attention by nudging at my hand. My heart exploded. This soon become our daily routine. Her confidence growing with every outing. With patience, Rosie has grown into a sweet, loyal, playful pup who aims to please.

Rosie has been at the shelter for 8 months now waiting for someone special to free her. Someone who sees what I saw and is willing to take the time to gain her trust. If you think you have it in your heart to be this someone for her please stop in at the CNY SPCA.

He was originally brought to the SPCA as a stray, and was found with a broken leg. Once his leg healed, we discovered that Apache had heartworm, and he spent months being treated. He has been in foster for a while but is now healthy and ready for a permanent home!

He has a heart of gold, and is just a friendly, dopey boy. Apache is full of puppy-like energy and absolutely loves to play with toys and go for walks. He has been working on loose leash walking and is getting the concept down well. He is also SUPER snuggly - once he gets all his wiggles out, he is completely content to curl up next to you. Giving kisses, getting belly rubs, and being generally goofy are his favorite activities. He already knows sit and shake and as of August, he is a graduate of the 4-week CNYSPCA basic obedience course. Apache is working really hard on focus, down, leave it, and more! 

Apache's ideal adoptive family would be a dog-savvy one that is consistent and patient as he continues to learn, and is home most or all of the time due to his separation anxiety. He needs to go to a home without small animals. He's lived with kids before and if there are kids in his new home, they should be older and know how to behave around dogs.

Apache is a member of our doggy playgroup. If you have a dog around his size, please call us to set up a meet and greet to see if they could be a good fit. After everything that has happened to him, he is ready to finally have a forever person he can count on. Please come and meet him soon.

That is over a year ago. Over a year in these four walls, over a year waiting to go home. She was found as a stray, and little was known about her, however she quickly became a staff and volunteer favorite. 

Tasha loves people. If you have the ability to scratch her butt, you are her best friend. If you have treats in your hand, you are her best friend. If you have a harness or a leash in your hand, if you love to walk and explore, you guessed it, you are her best friend. Tasha loves to walk and has great leash manners. She knows Ì¢åÛåÏsitÌ¢åÛåù, and Ì¢åÛåÏstayÌ¢åÛåù, Ì¢åÛåÏdownÌ¢åÛåù and would love to learn more! She gives the gentlest kisses and loves to sit back and take the world in with you once she exerts her zoomies. Tasha makes new friends everywhere she goes - a few volunteers and myself took her out in April for a Ì¢åÛåÏGirls DayÌ¢åÛåù (Country Max, Petco, etc) and everyone had the same question - 

How has this dog not found a home yet?! 

ThatÌ¢åÛåªs simple. Tasha cannot be around or live with other animals. She just does best on her own. Which, honestly, I think a lot of us can relate to. I could do without my own kind some days ?. Small kids are a no go for her too, she gets random spurts of energy and would hate to knock someone over. Respectful, sturdy (older) kids might be a different story. Additionally, she turns her back in her kennel and gives a side eye to those walking by. Hackles raised, sometimes growling. Sometimes she pretends thereÌ¢åÛåªs nobody there at all. SheÌ¢åÛåªs scared, sad, and lonely, and can you really blame her? 

As soon as you get her outside, she turns into the happiest angel puppy. Emphasis on puppy - sheÌ¢åÛåªs only 3, and has spent a year of that time in a kennel. 

Tasha is one of the most loyal, loving, silly girls I know. SheÌ¢åÛåªs done nothing to deserve the cards life has dealt her, and myself and so many others are rooting for her to find her fur-ever. 

I know thereÌ¢åÛåªs a childless couple out there who needs a pocket pittie. I know thereÌ¢åÛåªs a family with teens who finally feel ready after their last family pet passed. I know there is a single guy or gal who needs that missing piece. 

I just know it. 

Tasha has lots of friends at the shelter who love her so much, but she needs a forever home and family.   If you aren't the perfect fit, please share this with others.

My life has not been easy. You see, I was found as a bait dog connected to dog fighting right here in Central New York. Up until my rescue, I never knew what it was like to be loved and cared for, and unfortunately, I have the scars to prove it.

When some really nice Cruelty Investigators rescued me I knew that my life was about to change forever Ì¢åÛåÒ for the better. They brought me here to the CNY SPCA where I got the TLC I desperately needed. ThatÌ¢åÛåªs when my new home became the shelter, and for the first time in my life, I finally felt some peace. DonÌ¢åÛåªt get me wrong, for this IÌ¢åÛåªm very grateful. The staff and volunteers treat me very well and they love me, but theyÌ¢åÛåªre not my forever family. Certainly, I feel safe and happy at the shelter, but for my whole entire life IÌ¢åÛåªve wished for a loving family and a safe, secure home.

IÌ¢åÛåªm around 8 Ìâå? years old. Since IÌ¢åÛåªve had a traumatic past, IÌ¢åÛåªm not a fan of other animals so IÌ¢åÛåªd need to be your only pet and live in an adults-only household. I hope thatÌ¢åÛåªs not a problem. I can assure you that my heart is full of love and has been longing for a human to call my very own. One who will take me on gentle strolls around the block (IÌ¢åÛåªm easy to handle!) or snuggle with me on the couch and watch endless hours of TVÌ¢åÛå?especially movies where everyone lives happily ever after. IÌ¢åÛåªm a real sucker for those types of movies because thatÌ¢åÛåªs what I want Ì¢åÛåÒ to live happily ever after.

For now, I sit in my kennel where I can see lots of people walk by without really stopping to see the real me. I try to not let this discourage me and remind myself that none of us (humans and animals alike) are immune to setbacks and challenges. Even after my rescue it was a bumpy road as I was diagnosed with heartworm and had to undergo several months of treatment earlier this year. Yet, my resilience has given me the strength and hope that the next person who passes by my kennel will stop and see the heart beneath the scars and love me just the way I am. IÌ¢åÛåªm certainly worthy of a second look if youÌ¢åÛåªd just give me a chance. In the words of my namesake Captain Jack Sparrow, Ì¢åÛåÏNot all treasure is silver and gold, mate.Ì¢åÛåù So, if you think you might have a spot in your heart for me, IÌ¢åÛåªd love to meet you.

IÌ¢åÛåªm really hoping this post finds someone out there ready to love me. A generous donor has already sponsored my adoption fee! If youÌ¢åÛåªre reading this but not in the position to adopt me, please share my post. Your share could be the one to find me a home.

History
I am the most delightful, adorable, sweet, funny, silly, loving, affectionate, and friendly little guy! I used to live in Katmandu, Nepal, on the streets (like a ton of dogs there), and life was awfully hard.

I had no idea how much harder it could get, but then I was struck by a motorbike or motorcar and became paralyzed from the waist down.  Oh boy, that was really rough.   But when faced with challenges, you just kind of figure it out, so I learned to drag myself around pretty well using my front arms! Thankfully, a wonderful Nepal rescue group found me dragging myself around like this, scooped me up, and took me to a local shelter. From there, a fabulous volunteer contacted Cayuga Dog Rescue, and they said that if she could get me to them, they would be delighted to take me into their foster program, since they have the best vets in the world right here at Cornell and a wonderful dog-loving community.

That lovely woman raised money for my very long international flight and off I went to New York City on April 2nd! Wow, what an adventureÌ¢åÛå?scary and loud and dark and upsetting, but soooo worth it because when I landed, I was greeted by the nicest CDR volunteers and from that moment on, life has been unbelievably wonderful!

Personality
I am such a little lovey-dovey guy!  I LOVE affection and attention!  I make adorable and very passionate squeaking sounds of delight when my foster parents come home from work, scamper (fast!) right over to them as they walk in the door, and nuzzle into their legs like crazy.  When they rub my face and neck (my favorites!), I close my eyes and lean my face into their hands more and more, it feels SO good. I cannot even believe how good it feels to have my face and neck rubbed, I could have that 24/7 and never tire of it.

I have a nicknameÌ¢åÛå?itÌ¢åÛåªs Ì¢åÛåÏScampers!Ì¢åÛåù    This is because I scamper about the house in the most adorable fashion.  I scamper over to the door to greet them when they come home, scamper along behind them as they move from room to room, and scamper along with the other dogs in the house (really fast) when they get excited about something going on outside!  My foster parents say my scampering is hilarious,  me zipping about the house on my butt or with my back legs folded under me, sailing by as if IÌ¢åÛåªm motorized!  They say if they put a little white sheet on top of me, and cut some eyeholes in it, when i sailed around I would totally look like one of those cartoon ghosts!

I have a lot of new, cool gear (thanks to the wonderful donors who sent in money for my care Ì¢åÛå?thank you, thank you thank you!) that helps me have a pretty regular doggy life despite my disability.  I have two favorites:  1) the hind-end harness which allows you to hold up my butt/hind end when I walk or run so my back legs donÌ¢åÛåªt drag.  You would be amazed at how fast I can run when my foster mom is holding my hind end in the harnessÌ¢åÛå?she has to break into an actual run alongside me to keep up even though I have little legs and she has big ones!  ?  And 2) the pet stroller that I get to sit in so we can go for longer Ì¢åÛåÏwalksÌ¢åÛåù so I can get to know my new neighborhood and new country!   Going out in the stroller is amazingly funÌ¢åÛå?we go to the park once a day, and I sit up in the stroller the whole time, super observant and super interested, watching and listening to everything!  An added bonus is that the people we stroll by all Ì¢åÛåÏoooohÌ¢åÛåù and Ì¢åÛåÏaaaahÌ¢åÛåù about how cute I am sitting there in my stroller, and they want to hear my story and meet me!  

IÌ¢åÛåªm very easygoing, extremely adaptable, and a generally chill guy.   I do my scampering around in the house and yard a bit, and sure love going out in the pet stroller for my daily Ì¢åÛåÏwalkÌ¢åÛåù in the local park, but otherwise, I am super content to lay around in one of the very comfy dog beds and just relax and nap.  If something interesting happens and the other dogs get to barking, IÌ¢åÛåªll check it out for sure, but then am happy to scamper back to a dog bed and get back to my relaxing.   Since I love people so much, love meeting new people, and am so chill and adaptable, the rescue folks think I would make an amazing therapy dog. I would love to earn my CGC and be a visiting dog to children, the elderly, or folks in hospitals!

I like dog toys like stuffed animals and bones and chew sticks, but the other dogs in my foster home get jealous over toys, so my foster parents explained that unfortunately they canÌ¢åÛåªt give me toys to play with, but that maybe in my forever home I will be able to have toys again.  ThatÌ¢åÛåªs ok, I understand!

Cohabitation
I love people!  So very, very much!  So far I like women and men equally (though I do give slight preference to anyone who rubs my face and neck, haha)!

I have been around some little kids and was just fine with them, and would be happy to live in a home with kids over 6.  Since my daily care (see medical section below) takes some time, the rescue folks think it makes most sense for me not to live in a home with toddlers, who require a lot of daily care themselves!

I am really good with other dogs!  When I meet new dogs, I will often growl when they get near to me, which the rescue folks say is very understandable given how vulnerable I am due to my paralysis.  When the other dogs are respectful of my nervousness and give me some space, I go on and make friends with them pretty quickly.  I just need to make sure that they are nice dogs before I let my guard down!   

I think cats are the same as chipmunks and squirrelsÌ¢åÛåÓcritters to be chased and barked at, so I need a cat-free home please.

Medical
Given my past, I am in pretty spectacular health!  IÌ¢åÛåªve had full blood work and chemistry panels which look Ì¢åÛåÏfabulous!Ì¢åÛåù according to the vet!  IÌ¢åÛåªve had a few urinary tract infections since arriving, which is pretty common for paralyzed dogs and get treated with a course of antibiotics.  The vets are working on figuring out a plan for me that hopefully will help me stop getting these so regularly. 

HereÌ¢åÛåªs the deal with my paralysisÌ¢åÛåÓI spent a bunch of time being looked at by the wonderful doctors up at Cornell Sports Medicine Clinic, and they say that I have an injury to my spine (most likely due to being hit by a car or motorcycle) that cannot be surgically fixed.  The injury makes it impossible for my brain to send messages to my legs and vice versa, so I canÌ¢åÛåªt regain normal walking ability.  
BUT, the good news is that I have lots of reflexes functioning very well in my legs and feet, so if I do daily exercises that strengthen my leg and hip muscles and reprogram healthy leg movement patterns, I could very possibly become what they call a Ì¢åÛåÏspinal walkerÌ¢åÛåù which means I could end up being able to walk to some degree (if a bit awkwardly), based totally on muscle reflexes!  My foster parents think it extremely likely that this will happen, since they are seeing improvement in my ability to bear weight on my back legs (once they get me into a standing position) already.  

I get 15 minutes or so of at-home PT every day, which I will need to continue probably forever.  ItÌ¢åÛåªs really easy, and has three parts:  1) they move my leg and feet joints around for a few minutes, a few times each day, 2) they stand me up (on carpeting or grass, not on slick floors), and let me practice putting weight on my legs and feet for a minute at a time, a few times a day, and 3) they take me out in my hind-end harness to walk and run around the yard a few times a day.  ThatÌ¢åÛåªs it!  

The only other care I need relates to going to the bathroom.  For peeing, my foster parents express (aka squoosh!) my bladder 3-5 times each day to help me empty my bladder so I donÌ¢åÛåªt dribble urine too much.  I also wear a belly band much of the time in the house to catch any drips that happen.  For pooping, they keep me on a regular meal schedule, so know when I need to poop.  They learned a little trick that gets me to poop on command, so there are rarely any accidents, no muss, no fuss!

Favorite Activities

Ì¢åÛå¢	Going for walks in my hind-end harness!  Going for strolls in my stroller!

Ì¢åÛå¢	Being part of a family!  Totally new thing for me, itÌ¢åÛåªs the BEST!
Ì¢åÛå¢	FOOD!!!!  It was so hard finding food to eat when I was homeless and paralyzed in KatmanduÌ¢åÛå?being given 2 delicious meals every day, plus snacks in between, is heaven!  The vet says I am allowed to gain a few more pounds and I am stoked to hear it!

History
Hi! My name is Trent. I was found on the streets of Trenton, NJ (hence my name) as a stray on 7/31 by Trenton Animal Control, and was discovered by my rescuer at a local animal hospital on 8/1. She saw the state I was in and was so sad for me; the doctors informed her that I would go back to a shelter in 1 more day. I looked very skinny (I was only 59 lbs. and should be 75lbs!) and am very sweet, but I was in very sad shape. She was told I'm between 8-10 years old, had a terrible flea & worm infestation, had a bladder infection, and a rock and screw in my stomach (I was so hungry... the streets were rough). She knew in my condition and age that I wouldn't be adopted unless I was healthy. The consensus was that I may not make it out of a shelter alive (old age and lots of medical problems aren't really appealing to most potential adopters, I guess). She later discovered I'm deaf (I guess I could've told her that, had she read my butt wiggles correctly...) and I'm slowly losing my eyesight (thickening of the lenses), but my nose works pretty well! My rescuer made a last-minute decision to have me \""special released\"" to her from Animal Control and she pledged to do everything in her power get me better. Since then, with the help of many heroes, I've been neutered, I no longer have an ear infection or a urinary infection, I've passed the rock and screw out of my system, and my 2 broken teeth have been removed! I take Carprofen daily for hip dysplasia, and will likely need to stay on Apoquel for my allergies. I weigh about 70 lbs. now - I love food! As much as I adore my rescuer, I know I'm now ready to go to my forever home. She has only a temporary pass from her landlords to have 2 animals (the lease says only 1!), and the fact that I really do not seem to understand why her cat doesn't want to be stomped on or chased. I am a very sweet boy, and my rescuer has shown me that I deserve a wonderful forever home to live out the rest of my years. I look forward to being spoiled with pets and treats the entire time. In return, I promise butt wiggles and snorts!

Personality
I love to greet every man, woman, child, and dog with curiosity, a sniff, and snorts. Since I'm deaf, I don't really react to any sounds... apparently things like thunder go undetected! Dogs barking, doors opening, wrappers opening... nothing!. This can create a challenge when you need my attention, but creates a great environment for when there are storms or when other dogs are being crazy. I do my own thing and do not get distracted easily.

I'm a bit older so my memory isn't so great, but I think I may have been abused in the past. Sometimes I flinch when you move quickly toward my head, but once you pet me, it's forgotten and my butt wiggles and I throw a snort your way. I LOVE TREATS! I like to go for walks and I'm pretty good on a leash. I mostly only like walks in the evening, though... I'm not really a fan of the 5:00 am walks my owner seems to be doing lately! (Crazy lady!). 

Sometimes I snore, even when my eyes are open. I'm not really sure what the point is of these rope things, stuffed puff balls that look like other animals, and non-food items. If it isn't edible, I don't want it. I mean, I once ate a rock and screw, but I'm living the high life now. Only the good stuff from here on out! 

Sometimes I get spunky and run around... sometimes I fall because my hips aren't so great, but you'll rarely hear me get upset about it. I often just get back up and keep right on truckin'. Sometimes I fall going up the stairs, but my rescuer gives me a boost or a lift and all is well. My rescuer and I fool around sometimes and even though she'll put her whole hand or arm in my mouth, I won't bite. Human doesn't taste good if you ask me. 

I like a lot of attention, and I like to be near you. If you stop petting me and I'm not done, I'll nudge you until you keep going. If I know where you are, you'll feel and hear me close behind. I like to be involved with whatever you've got going on, whether it's cooking (I like when my rescuer drops stuff, and lucky for me, she's pretty clumsy), cleaning, or just hanging around. If you sit still long enough, I'll lay down and take a snoozer (my snores will be very soothing, I promise). 

I'm pretty much house-broken, but since I'm old, I can really only hold it for a few hours when I'm not crated. I can hold it much longer in my crate (about 10 hours!), though I find it ideal to not be in one if I don't have to (a PB-filled kong might persuade me to deal with it for a bit, though). 

I'd love a home with a human that understands my aging body, is home often, and has a big fenced-in yard or large run. I'd love a home without young kids (I'm not so great at knowing when food is or isn't mine and, because i can't see well, sometimes I can't tell the difference between treats and fingers. I was hungry for a long time and I think it's made me far more food-motivated than most other pups!). I'm not a huge fan of cats, but I think I'd do great in a home with a dog-savvy, calmer dog! I don't really know a lot of commands, but not being able to hear hasn't helped that. I learn from whether or not I get a pet or a treat after I do something my rescuer wants me to do. I need patience, but I swear I'm worth it. Also, as a bonus: I look really cute in a bandanna. 

Cohabitation
I live with 1 human, a male cat, no kids, and no other dogs. I like pretty much any human, but would do best with older kids, no cats, and maybe another dog if we're both on the same page! 

Favorite Activities
Whatever my human is doing, mostly, but I do like to eat, snore, and go for walks. I don't really understand what \""toys\"" are, because I don't think I've ever used them. Maybe in time, their meaning will make sense.

Why I am Looking for a New Home
My human has been very kind to me, and her landlords have been gracious enough to let me stay here while I healed, but the permission was only temporary. My human is only supposed to have 1 animal, and she's already has a cat who has been with her for 9 years (and, honestly, we don't get along much anyway!). I also need a human who works closer to home, or from home, and has more space for me. I don't like being in a crate that much, and I think I'd also like a gentle canine companion. 

Medical
If you read my history, you already know the deal, but I'll summarize real quick. When my rescuer saved me, I was severely underweight,  wasn't neutered, and had the following:
lots of fleas and worms (but was being treated right then by the amazing doctors); a rock and screw in my stomach; an ear infection; a urinary infection; 2 broken teeth; severe allergies; and couldn't really walk well. Since then, all my infections are gone, my broken teeth have been removed, I'm now neutered, I'm on pain meds for my hips, and Apoquel for my allergies. I'm up to date on all my shots, too! My only remaining concern is that I had a small lump removed recently and the doctor found that it was a \""low grade mast cell tumor.\"" I have 2 more lumps that need to get removed soon, just to be safe. 

Summary
I came from a hazy background; I can't really recall where I've been, but I'm so happy that I got a second chance at this life. I've come a long way and am a whole new dog. I have much more energy and zest for life than I did 4 weeks ago. I'm ready for a new start. I would love to get my second chance with you. Will you be my forever human?

Personality

When I first came into the CDR foster program last summer, I was terrified.  I hid in the back of my (open) crate and didnÌ¢åÛåªt come out for nearly 2 days.  It took an awful lot of courage for me to finally venture out of the crate, and then it was slow going in terms of me building trust and not being so scared all the time.  Then, after a few weeks in my foster home, a very strange thing happened.  There was this gentle whooshing motion coming from somewhere behind me, and it was very confusing what was going on.  Then my foster mom started laughing and had a smile bigger than IÌ¢åÛåªd ever seen and she said, Ì¢åÛåÏChloe!  You are wagging your tail for the first time, how wonderful!Ì¢åÛåù She was right!  And it did feel wonderful!

I wag my tail all the time now, there is so much to feel happy about.   Once I know and trust you, I love you deeply and without reserve--I am extremely affectionate and sweet and adorable and playful with everyone whom I know and trust.  I love to follow my foster mom around the house, I love hanging out next to her, I love cuddling with her, and will crawl right up into her lap if she lets me!  I am a humungous mush. If I could have my way, I would lay in bed all day long with my person and cuddle!

Here are some fun facts about me:

Ìâåá         I love to sleep in bed with my person. I am extremely cuddly and always want to have some part of me touching you. Therefore, I am also a great heater when itÌ¢åÛåªs cold. J

Ìâåá         Though I have great playful energy sometimes, IÌ¢åÛåªm actually somewhat lazy if you allow me to be! I am happy to lounge around the house with you all day long.

Ìâåá         My favorite way to Ì¢åÛå÷remindÌ¢åÛåª you to keep petting me is by using my paw to gently nudge you (which apparently makes you fall even more deeply in love with me)!

Ìâåá         My 2nd foster mom says that seeing my tail wag is one of the best feelings in the world.

Ìâåá         I am a very well-mannered lady and like to lay down with my paws crossed. I am also very polite when eating (I take tiny bites and chew thoroughly) and am very gentle when eating out of your hand!

Ìâåá         I enjoy leisurely Ì¢åÛå÷sniffing expeditionsÌ¢åÛåª around the fenced yard quite a lot!

Ìâåá         Overall, I am a big mush who wants nothing more than a person who is going to love me enough to make up for the lack of love and care I had before coming to CDR. I am a goofy, sometimes hilariously awkward, beautiful, sweet, soft, fun, loving, smart, and loyal girl!

I do want you to understand though, that despite my affectionate ways with people whom I love and trust, I am still quite scared of strangers (especially men) and of new situations, new locations, new activities, and new sights and sounds.  I prefer things to be calm and predictable, and I prefer people who are happy, friendly, encouraging, patient, and positive.  It takes me a while to get comfortable with just about any new thing, so I need an adopter who is patient, gentle, understanding, and encouraging.  ItÌ¢åÛåªs good for me to be encouraged to experience new things, but I need to take it very slowly, and before we do any of that, I need first to feel quite safe and secure with you. 

And just so you have a picture of what I do when I am scaredÌ¢åÛå?I mostly hide or retreat.  I hide in my crate or retreat upstairs or to a far corner of the house.  If we are outside on leash and I get scared of some noise, I might just freeze in place or want to quickly return home.  Sometimes I will bark instead, and this is usually when I canÌ¢åÛåªt hide or retreat (e.g., I am on leash and canÌ¢åÛåªt just leave and hide), or if I am particularly upset (e.g., I canÌ¢åÛåªt get comfortable in the presence of my foster momÌ¢åÛåªs very nice (they tell me!) male tenant, who lives in the cottage next door).

Men are much scarier to me than are women.  I lucked out though, because when my main foster mom went out of the country for a month, a new 2nd foster mom came to stay with me, and she has a boyfriend who visited on some weekends, and I found out that not all men are scary!  He is the first man IÌ¢åÛåªve ever met who I really love!  He is a very soft spoken and gentle man, and he was careful to move very slowly when in my presence until I felt more relaxed near him, and he was super generous with the cheese (smoked Gouda is my favorite, just FYI) and turkey breast.  And all of those things really did the trick because now he is one of my all-time favorite people!  We had loads of snuggle and love time, and I would be very excited when he came to visit!  So thatÌ¢åÛåªs major progress for sure, but because I am generally much more fearful of men, the rescue folks feel that an adoptive placement for me should probably include a primary caretaker who is female.

I really like going for leashed walks, but can become startled if I hears noises that are unexpected, unfamiliar, very loud, etc.  I have gained some comfort in going for hikes at local spots like Buttermilk Falls, Robert Treman State Park, around Beebe lake, and more, but am not one to want to meet lots of strangers or to have kids running up to pet me.That would be scary! IÌ¢åÛåªve even gotten brave enough on one or two occasions to venture into the water with foster mom #2 when the weather was warmer. I am cautiously willing to try new things, but I need support and encouragement from my safe and loving person.

AndÌ¢åÛå?news flash!  While I seemed to not like other dogs when I first arrived (lots of growling and snapping), recent events suggest that I love having a smaller, very friendly, male doggy friend who can show me the ropes! My 2nd foster momÌ¢åÛåªs friend has this great dog named Riley, a Petit Basset Griffon Vandeen, who has been a Ì¢åÛå÷Doggy AmbassadorÌ¢åÛåª for me. He is a fellow rescue who has been extremely influential in showing me that the world is not such a scary place.  But as with all things, I needed to meet him very slowly and very carefully.  When my 2ndfoster mom was introducing me to Reilly, we went on many, many long leashed walks together (keeping 8-10 feet apart at all times) before we ever interacted off leash in my fenced yard.   The rescue folks think I might love a smaller doggy brother who was relaxed and confident and could help me be more like that too.

And speaking of fenced yardsÌ¢åÛå?I LOVE to romp around in the fenced yard!  And since it takes me some time to feel comfortable going on leashed walks with a new person, the rescue folks feel that an adoptive home with a fenced yard is important for me.  Also, I have a very high prey drive, and will bolt to chase after any small critter that I see. 

I am a fine eater, and appreciate all kinds of treats. I also love my crate (itÌ¢åÛåªs left open at all times), and I use it as a comforting, safe place in which to retreat anytime I feel scared. I am totally fine being left freely in the house aloneÌ¢åÛåÓI have never been destructive in any way. I do  really appreciate being near my foster mom, but am also all right spending time on my own!

Cohabitation and my ideal adoptive home
I need a very special adopter! One who is very calm, caring, understanding, positive, encouraging, and patient. One with a gentle nature, and preferably some experience with scared/shy/cautious dogs.

Since I get scared of loud or unexpected noises, sights, and movements, I need a home without children or teens, and would do well with a person or couple who have a calm, quiet, mellow lifestyle.

We are not clear yet whether I am ok with cats, but given my high prey drive, my ideal home would not have cats.

And last, we hope that I can have a fenced yard, since I enjoy running around off leash, but cannot be off-leash unless in a securely fenced area. The reason I was chained up to a barn at my previous home was because I kept running off the farm property and not coming back.  And when those people initially surrendered me to the Cornell vet students, I bolted with fear, slipped my collar, and took off.  It took them 10 days of constant effort to catch me!  I am a dog who will likely never be ok off leash unless in a securely fenced yard.

And finally, because whomever adopts me will need to keep working with me to help me continue to increase my confidence, CDR will pay for FOUR in-home training sessions with her adopter and our wonderful trainer (for a local adopter) or online Zoom (like Skype) sessions with same trainer

History
I was found as a stray and landed in a rough, dismal shelter in Tennessee. Luckily a wonderful rescue worker there knows about Cayuga Dog Rescue, and knew they would want to rescue me! I hopped a ride on the Canine Underground Railroad and made my way all the way to Ithaca to the CDR foster program! I love my new life, getting to meet new people, playing with all of my cool new toys, and relaxing on my comfy dog bed. ItÌ¢åÛåªs been so much fun!!
Personality
I am a happy, friendly, enthusiastic little love bug! I have a lot of joyful enthusiasm and can be really affectionate with the hugs and the kisses! I like meeting new people (I am waggy and friendly) but love it so much more when I get to develop close and loving special relationships.  Though I appear nothing but happy and confident, IÌ¢åÛåªm actually secretly also a bit insecure and shy, and I love how great it feels to get to know people well and know for sure that they are kind and safe and trustworthy!

Once I know you a bit, I am very affectionate, kissy-kissy (Ì¢åÛåÏlick! lick!Ì¢åÛåù) and playful!  My favorite thing is to run around in a fenced yard, chasing after balls or toys, and then cuddling up close to you and showering you with gentle little kisses! I really like when people sit with me on the floor and give me scratches and pets and cuddles and attention. Sometimes I even get back massages, which are the best!!
I also really love playing with my toys! Toys are so great, I never had any down in Tennessee! Turns out that i get overstimulated by stuffed animal toys and can't calm down, so it's best that I not have those! 
Sometimes when I get to playing, I roll over onto my back and I get stuck there!  It takes me a lot of wiggles to right myself again, its pretty silly!!!


Even though I am a happy playful young doggy, IÌ¢åÛåªm not hyper (except for when you give me stuffed animal toys), and I also can be chill at times for sure. Sometimes I just feel like laying around chewing on my Kong toy, or having a small siesta, and I always know when itÌ¢åÛåªs time to go to sleep at night and IÌ¢åÛåªm happy for it to be bedtime! I am quiet through the night but happy to get up in the morning!


I love going on walks!! I really love smelling exciting new things outside, itÌ¢åÛåªs endlessly fascinating and I love doing it with you. And get thisÌ¢åÛå?even though IÌ¢åÛåªm just a youngster, I am excellent on the leash, I never pull as long as I am wearing my Sensation harness (which helps me not pull, but still)!  Pretty good for a pup my age! I am also 100% housebroken, though since I have been bunking at a kennel for the last many months I might need a little refresher course to help me adjust to your new schedule and being back in a home setting.

I am a smart little girl! I am learning new things every day which is really fun, especially as it involves all kinds of yummy treats and praise!

I would love to have a forever home with a fenced backyard so that I can run around and play or where I could get taken on excellent daily leashed walks!  

Cohabitation
I love people very much, especially once I get to know them.  I would love sweet, friendly, gentle, reassuring, and fun adults!

Kids 16 or older would be a great fit for meÌ¢åÛåÒ IÌ¢åÛåªd prefer not to be around younger ones all the time, Too much commotion and movement for me!

I am very nervous around other dogs and donÌ¢åÛåªt like having to share space with them (inside or even in a fenced yard).  So, I would really like to be your only dog! 
 I am fine walking by other dogs on leash-- as long as you donÌ¢åÛåªt let them come over to meet and greet.  That would make me feel very threatened!  

I am not ok with cats, so a no-cat household please!

Favorite Activities
o	Playing with you! Playing with toys!
o	Your attention and cuddles and kisses and petting!
o	Going for hikes in the woods with you! Any kind of leashed walk is great!
o	Soft dog beds! Whoo hoo!!

Medical
I am in terrific health! I have a bit of seasonal allergies, so take a few Benadryl sometimes, but otherwise, all seems perfect!

Summary
I am a playful, happy, incredibly loving girl who so wants a forever home filled with calm and fun and love and joy and playing and kisses! I would love to have a forever person who will give me attention, take me on walks and hikes, and who will sit with me and just give me some belly rubs and back scratches! I donÌ¢åÛåªt like lots of change, so hope for a forever home that has a stable, consistent routine without much chaos or hustle bustle. If this sounds like you, please apply to adopt me! I want to find my forever family soon!!

Special Notes? Been in foster care for *3 years*! Also, see medical section and personality below.
Background
I was rescued from an overcrowded KY shelter when I was only 4 months old and have been here in foster care with CDR ever since. When I was first rescued by CDR, their nice vets found that I had a previously fractured pelvis (consistent with being kicked, hard) and one of my ears appears to have been Ìâå?-cut off with scissors. Clearly, my first few months of life were rough, but youÌ¢åÛåªd never know it, as I am the happiest, sweetest, most adoring and adorable girl around!
Personality
I am a super friendly, happy, playful and affectionate girl! Everyone always says how much they love me and how sweet I am. I love attention of all sortsÌ¢åÛå?I love being petted and cuddled, having my belly rubbed, giving and getting kisses, and playing all sorts of games! My tail goes Ì¢åÛåÏswish-swish-swishÌ¢åÛåù when you look at me or come over to hang out with me and IÌ¢åÛåªm very responsive to any type of affection you give meÌ¢åÛå?if you kiss and pet and cuddle me, I donÌ¢åÛåªt just lay there and soak it in, I kiss and cuddle and pet you back!
I am also smart! I have graduated (with flying colors) 2 basic obedience classes and also did well at agility! I am terrific at \""sit, down, wait, high-five, back-back-back, touch, and watch!\"" I love learning and am very eager to please you (and get treats!).
I can be a little bit nervous with strangers (especially if they are staring at me!) until I have had a chance to get to know them a bit. When I was younger, I was terrified of kids (in the age range of 4-10 years old) and also of short, heavyset blonde women--I used to bark at them frantically and genuinely seemed utterly terrified. The rescue folks think that maybe it was a short, heavyset blonde woman and her kids who cut off my ear and kicked me hard enough to break my pelvis. As I got older, I seemed to do better with children, but I had 2 very weird incidents (1 involving a child) that might indicate that I still can get very stressed around kids. I can tell you about those incidents if you want to learn more about me!
Favorite Activities
I love chasing, pouncing on, and playing with my rope toys and my stuffed animals and I have lots of fun playing tug of war with my foster parents. I am fantastic at Ì¢åÛåÏfetchÌ¢åÛåù and love fetching toys, balls, sticks, and really just about anything you are willing to throw. If you get distracted, I sweetly nudge you with the item to remind you that itÌ¢åÛåªs time to throw it again! And while I love interacting with you, if youÌ¢åÛåªre busy, I can entertain myself. I find a toy and throw it up in the air, or I run around the yard discovering sticks to play with (and then prancing around with them proudly hanging out of my mouth). IÌ¢åÛåªm also happy to nap! My foster parents say I do about a zillion things that make them laugh!
I love going for walks on leash and love hikes on trail. I occasionally go jogging with my foster mom, and like a couple of miles, but don't seem interested in going much farther. I walk well in a Sense-ible harness (but do pull a bunch without one).
Co-habitation
I get along great with other dogs (big & small) and also with cats. I live with 5 other dogs at present, and I love playing chase, am great at doggy wrestling, and I can adapt my play style for Ì¢åÛåÏrough and tumbleÌ¢åÛåù playmates, and also for more gentle play styles. I have gone to doggy daycare quite a lot, and everyone says I am terrific with all the people and the dogs! I do have a few slightly I irritating (to the home dogs) habits, like I think I need to Ì¢åÛåÏround the other dogs upÌ¢åÛåù when we all run out into the fenced yard, but itÌ¢åÛåªs not too bad and my foster mom is helping me to learn that itÌ¢åÛåªs not my job to do this, and that actually the other dogs prefer it if I mind my business! I bark quite strongly at other dogs who I donÌ¢åÛåªt know when I see them out on leashed walks, but am great when I actually get to meet them.
Medical Concerns/Special Needs
I am super healthy but do have one chronic medical condition and probably will for life. The vets were never able to figure out with certainty why (though some think it might be nerve damage from my early pelvic fracture), but I have had a significant problem with urinary incontinence since I arrived (itÌ¢åÛåªs much better nowÌ¢åÛå?keep reading!). Aside from the housekeeping inconvenience of a dog who leaks urine, this was a serious medical concern because my leaking caused me to have nearly constant urinary tract infections, which over time, could lead to grave or even life-threatening medical conditions. After over a year of diagnostic evaluation at Cornell and trials on many medications, I finally got a surgery that improved things significantly! I do still leak (thus my adorable diapers and nickname Ì¢åÛåÏcutie pants,Ì¢åÛåù) but since the surgery, and in conjunction with some daily medication, the leaking is much, much less than it was before and is easily managed by my wearing doggy diapers. The other good news is that my UTIÌ¢åÛåªs are now being successfully controlled by me taking a low dose of antibiotics nightly, and we are all hopeful that this will continue!
Summary
I am an all-around incredibly fabulous dog! I am very smart, learn things super quickly, and am incredibly fun-loving and affectionate. IÌ¢åÛåªm all about play and affection and loving life and everyone in it! I know I am a slightly special needs girl due to my diapers, but I am so wonderful, and for the right person (who doesnÌ¢åÛåªt mind a little extra care-taking), I will be your super beloved, soul-mate dog!
